    "## Introduction\n",
    "Hand drawings require a varying degree of dexterity and cognitive ability, and have historically been used to assess the state of cognitive diseases (Brantjes and Bouma, 1991). The drawings can also be designed to stress a specific motor or cognitive skill; for example, drawings containing small details will require precision whereas drawings containing 3-dimensional representations will require the ability to perceive and reproduce perspective (Clare, 1983).\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research (Rouleau et al., 1992) has shown great potential in diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from patient drawings, mainly focused on clock drawings (Wolf-Klein et al., 1989) which require a combination of motor and cognitive skills (Agrell and Dehlin, 1998); however, more recent work has focused on analysis of data produced by costly medical equipment like brain imaging, typically via magnetic resonance imaging (Khedher et al., 2015) but also magnetic resonance tomography (Almkvist and Winblad, 1999). Less invasive tests using biomarkers from blood tests have been studied, but there's still a need for non-invasive, inexpensive tests (Jellinger et al., 2008)."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State of the Art\n",
    "Deep neural networks with several convolutional layers currently produce the best results for classification tasks related to hand-srawn sketches (Sert and Boyacı, 2019) as well as more realistic paintings (Shen et al., 2019) or even digital sketches (Ha and Eck, 2018). Several specific deep neural network architectures are commonly used, for example *GoogLeNet* was recently used to perform computer-aided diagnoses from medical scans (Balagourouchetty et al., 2019) and *ResNet34* for assessment of breast tumor cellularity (Rakhlin et al., 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preprocessing\n",
    "Data preprocessing was a crucial component of the learning pipeline due to the following challenging characteristics of the dataset:\n",
    "- The dataset is relatively small for the proper application of deep learning techniques (Soekhoe et al., 2016).\n",
    "- Each image scan contains both the subject drawings and the drawing templates, presenting a non-trivial challenge to separate them during processing. Further, the placement of the subject drawings and drawing templates was inconsistent across image scans.\n",
    "- The image scans frequently contain a lot of noise, and the images were not scanned using consistent parameters which lead to image attributes like white balance being observably different across different scans.\n",
    "- The medium used, pencil and paper, leads to varying degrees of contrast in the subject drawing; some subjects pressed the pencil a lot harder against the paper than others. \n",
    "- Some image scans contain multiple subject drawings, which required for some criteria to be established in order to consistently choose which one to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/preprocessing_issues.png\">\n",
    "<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4. Preprocessing issues.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps were taken in order to preprocess the dataset:\n",
    "1. One image scan for each drawing template was hand-picked and the drawing template was cropped using the open source image editing software *GIMP*.\n",
    "1. Using purpose-built software, the coordinates of the subject drawing and the template were extracted from the image scans. If more than one subject drawing was present, the subject drawing that most resembled the template was chosen after a visual comparison.\n",
    "1. Using the coordinates as an approximate reference, the subject drawing was extracted from the image scan, and subsequently denoised and binarized using well-established computer vision techniques (Szeliski, 2011) such as non-local means denoising (Buades et al., 2011) and adaptive thresholding.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/preprocessed_drawing.png\">\n",
    "<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 5. Preprocessed drawing.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Preparation\n",
    "Two independent datasets were used to train different models. For one, drawing-evaluation pairs were used for the input and label, respectively (*ungrouped* dataset). For the other, image drawings were grouped by evaluation, such that each evaluation for a given subject represents a datapoint consisting of N drawings -- one for each template (*grouped* dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the grouped dataset, datapoints where not all drawings are available were discarded, and the evaluation results were encoded into a binary variable indicating whether the subject displayed any cognitive deficiency, or if it was considered healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is divided into the following standard (Reitermanová, 2010) subsets:\n",
    "1. **Train**: datapoints that are fed into the model to compute the error gradient at each iteration.\n",
    "1. **Test**: datapoints used to compute a score at each iteration, which is then used to determine if early stopping is necessary.\n",
    "1. **Validation**: left-out subset used to evaluate the model after training has completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsets are sampled randomly. If the validation subset has a class balance which differs from the class balance of the whole dataset by more than 5%, the subsets are randomly resampled until this criteria is reached. Because of the limited size of the dataset, this prevents cases where a model seemingly performed very well, but in reality the validation subset had a severe problem of class imbalance (Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Training\n",
    "All tried model architectures can be categorized as deep neural networks. Some of the models are an exact copy of known models such as *GoogLeNet* or *ResNet34* (He et al., 2015), known for performing well against the ImageNet dataset and adaptiveness to transfer learning (Talo et al., 2019) including applicability to sketch drawings (Ballester and Araujo, 2016). For those models, the input images were resized to match what the model expects (224x224 in most cases). The models prefixed with *QD-* are heavily inspired by the architecture described by Ha and Eck (2018) applied to the *Quick, Draw!* dataset named *sketch-rnn* (see fig. 11). A number of hyperparameters are identified, such as batch size, ratio of train-to-test and test-to-validation subset size; all combinations of parameter sets are explored using an exhaustive approach. The potential values for the parameters were chosen based on other, well-performing models in the computer vision domain (Russakovsky et al., 2015). Most of the parameters had little effect on the model performance outside of fine-tuning, although bigger kernel and batch sizes yield marginally improved accuracy.\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several key insights that were derived from our results. Most importantly, it appears to be plausible to perform early detection of cognitive diseases from subject drawings in a semi-automated way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, a custom model trained from scratch outperformed known models trained using transfer learning, even though conditions seemed favourable for transfer learning given the small dataset and multi-dimensional features. Further, the models trained using transfer learning barely outperformed the naive classifier and some had an area under ROC < 0.5 (see fig. 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another surprising result was that exclusion of any drawing category had a significant negative effect on the model performance, especially for the QD-grouped model which yielded a decrease in accuracy of over 5% leaving all other parameters equal. From our understanding of the data, we posit that this result is due to the increased information for each evaluation being available simultaneously to the model in a single datapoint. Alone, some drawing categories may have more relevant information than others; but using all drawing categories consistently yields better-performing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also explains why the QD-grouped model vastly outperformed all other models. Even though the much larger ungrouped dataset available during training should have a significant impact in model performance, grouping the drawings by evaluation allows for the model to combine the information from multiple drawings to achieve a better accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Work\n",
    "One of the main areas left to explore are different parameters and model architectures. A completely exhaustive approach is not feasible due to the large amount of resources required for model training, but given that a relatively small amount of model architectures were tried, it is likely that further exploration would yield improved results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may also be worth exploring why the transfer learning models did not perform well with this dataset, when other models did. It is possible that the larger number of model parameters requires more than 1000 iterations until convergence. \n",
    "\n",
    "For future experiments, changing the medium from paper to a digital drawing would potentially allow for a fully automated solution, avoiding most of the preprocessing currently necessary when using paper scans."
